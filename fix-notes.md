# Dependency Compatibility Changes

The deployment was failing due to multiple compatibility issues:

1. **ESLint Version Conflict**:
   - Changed ESLint from v9.24.0 to v8.57.0 to be compatible with eslint-config-react-app@7.0.1

2. **React Version**:
   - Downgraded React from v19.1.0 to v18.2.0
   - Downgraded React DOM from v19.1.0 to v18.2.0
   - Downgraded React-related types to be compatible with React 18

3. **UI Libraries**:
   - Changed @mui dependencies to stable versions
   - Downgraded @mui/material and @mui/icons-material from v7.x to v5.x
   - Downgraded @mui/x-data-grid from v7.x to v6.x

4. **Firebase**:
   - Downgraded Firebase from v11.6.0 to v10.12.0 (stable version)

5. **React Router**:
   - Downgraded react-router-dom from v7.4.1 to v6.22.3 (stable version)

6. **Testing Libraries**:
   - Updated testing libraries to compatible versions

7. **Utilities**:
   - Updated web-vitals and other utility libraries

## Next Steps

After these changes, we need to:

1. Check for breaking changes, especially in:
   - MUI v5 vs MUI v7
   - React Router v6 vs v7
   - Firebase v10 vs v11
   - React 18 vs React 19

2. Possible code adjustments:
   - Router configuration (if using v7-specific features)
   - Firebase authentication methods
   - MUI component props or styling

3. Focus areas:
   - Router setup
   - Authentication flow
   - UI components
